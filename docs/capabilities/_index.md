# Capabilities

Reference for all declared capabilities across the Oxagen platform.
Each capability is implemented across API, MCP, and agent surfaces with
contract-first design, IAM enforcement, and instrumentation. Following
[ADR-043](../adr/ADR-043-runtime-excision.md), Oxagen is a governance plane —
it does not run agents. Deleted runtime families (sandboxes, code execution,
subagent fan-out, background tasks, file locks, plans, skills, evals,
automations/workflows, browser tools, content generation, research swarm,
web fetch/search, and repo mutations) no longer have capability pages.

**308 capabilities across 47 domains.**

Capabilities granted to an agent as a set have a page of their own:
[the ontology read set](_ontology-read-set.md) covers the graph reads and the
`toolPolicy.ontology` opt-in.

## Agent (58)

- [agent.approval.list](agent.approval.list.md) — List the workspace's pending tool-call approvals, soonest expiry first, cursor-paged, optionally narrowed to one run
- [agent.approval.list_resolved](agent.approval.list_resolved.md) — List the workspace's resolved approvals, most recently resolved first, cursor-paged, optionally narrowed to one run or a resolved-at time range, including the rule that auto-approved a call no person looked at
- [agent.approval.resolve](agent.approval.resolve.md) — Approve or deny a pending tool-call approval request; resolution ends the tool-call wait and streams the next step
- [agent.credential.rotate](agent.credential.rotate.md) — Rotate an agent's long-lived credential: retire the current key and mint a replacement, returned once
- [agent.debug.trace](agent.debug.trace.md) — Diagnose why an agent execution failed as a structured failure frame: failing step, error class, parsed top stack frames, related spans, and deterministically-ranked suspect files (optional LLM diagnosis via summarize)
- [agent.definition.commit](agent.definition.commit.md) — Commit an agent's definition file (.oxagen/agents/<slug>.toml) to a branch of the workspace repository and open the pull request that publishes it, or add to the branch's open pull request; the default branch is never written
- [agent.definition.create](agent.definition.create.md) — Create a new agent definition — inserts the agent identity row (draft, inactive) and an immutable v1 version snapshot with the supplied, schema-validated config
- [agent.definition.delete](agent.definition.delete.md) — Soft-delete an agent definition and its delegated IAM principal together, in one lifecycle
- [agent.definition.get](agent.definition.get.md) — Fetch an agent definition with its active (or latest) version config, parsed and validated
- [agent.definition.list](agent.definition.list.md) — List the agent definitions in the current workspace with identity, lifecycle status, deployment posture, and latest version number
- [agent.definition.publish](agent.definition.publish.md) — Publish an agent version — marks it published, checksums its canonical config, and sets it as the active version (immutable thereafter)
- [agent.definition.suggest](agent.definition.suggest.md) — AI-assisted agent setup — turns a plain-language description into a complete draft agent configuration (identity, instructions, graph access, tools, triggers), grounded in the workspace's real skills, ontologies, MCP servers, and capabilities

- [agent.definition.update](agent.definition.update.md) — Update an agent definition by snapshotting a new unpublished version with the updated config; the version number is bumped

## Partner connectors

Oxagen supports both built-in connectors (GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, Linear)
and partner-authored connectors loaded from a hosted `schema.yaml` URL.

Partner schemas follow the same `ConnectorPlugin` format as built-in schemas.
The platform fetches, validates, and caches partner schemas transparently —
the `plugin.schema.get` and `integration.install` capabilities handle both
paths without separate APIs.
