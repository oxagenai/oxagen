// set_approval_rules — replace the workspace's auto-approval rules (MC spec
// §6.9 part 2, App. E; ADR-070).
//
//   1. Role gate — assertOrgRole: org Owner or Admin, for the signed-in user
//      or the creator of the API key (resolveActingUserId). The kernel's IAM
//      check allows every capability for a non-enterprise org, so the handler
//      checks (INV-29).
//   2. One transaction, under the workspace's rule-set lock:
//      a. When the caller sends `replaces`, the stored rules must still be the
//         set it read, or the write is refused as `rule_set_changed`. That is
//         what makes a one-rule edit built on an earlier read safe: a rule
//         another person deleted or switched off since cannot be written back.
//      b. A rule whose body matches the stored rule of the same id is carried
//         through as stored, stamp and all. Only new and changed rules run
//         the guards of `assertRulesSavable` — every tool pattern matches a
//         declared tool, every measure a condition names is declared by it,
//         and the caller holds the org role accountable for every consequence
//         those tools carry — and only they are stamped. Re-stamping an
//         unchanged rule would re-authorise it without anyone choosing to:
//         a rule held back as `consequences_changed` would start releasing
//         calls again because a different rule was edited. A rule the
//         caller names in `saving` is checked and stamped even when its body
//         is unchanged: saving a held rule again is how it is re-authorised.
//      c. The whole clause is replaced. A refusal leaves the stored rules
//         exactly as they were.
//   3. The new set is returned with its counters, so the page needs no second
//      read to redraw.
