// list_resolved_approvals: the workspace's resolved approvals, most recently
// resolved first, cursor-paged, optionally narrowed to one run or a resolved
// time range. The read `list_approvals` cannot serve: that capability filters
// `resolution IS NULL`, so a row an auto-approval rule resolved the instant it
// was written never appears there (#3153).
//
// This is the read side of `autoApprovePath` (`packages/rules/src/auto-approval-path.ts`):
// every call a rule released without a person writes a fully resolved row,
// `resolution: "approved"`, `resolvedByPolicy`, `autoRuleId`, `ruleIds`,
// `inputDigest`, `resolvedAt`, and until this capability existed, nothing
// could read that row back. A row a person resolved (`resolvedByUserId` set)
// appears here too, so the same query answers both "what did the rule let
// through" and "what did a person approve or deny".
//
// A console read is outside the metering surface (ADR-052 exclusion 2,
// INV-28), so the contract declares `noBillingGate: true`.
