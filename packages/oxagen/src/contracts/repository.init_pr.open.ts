/**
 * `open_init_pr`: add Oxagen to one of the workspace's repositories by opening
 * a pull request that puts the `.oxagen/` tree there (Mission Control spec
 * §10.2; the init wizard on the Repositories page).
 *
 * It is the only write that can run against a repository Oxagen has never
 * written to, and it still writes only to a branch: `oxagen/init`, from the
 * production branch, with one pull request back into it. Nothing reaches the
 * production branch until a person merges that pull request on GitHub.
 *
 * The pull request carries six files: `.oxagen/workspace.toml` and
 * `.oxagen/rules/governance.toml` as the caller reviewed them, `.gitkeep`
 * files that hold `.oxagen/rules/`, `.oxagen/proposals/` and
 * `.oxagen/agents/`, and `.gitignore` with the machine-local
 * `.oxagen/workspace.json` and `.stella/private/` added when missing.
 * `governance.toml` is the one file nothing else in the product writes, so its
 * text is checked before anything is pushed: it must parse and declare exactly
 * the mode the caller chose.
 *
 * Idempotent: an init pull request already open for the repository is
 * answered as it is (`reused: true`) and nothing is pushed.
 *
 * Refusals: `not_found: repository_not_linked`, `conflict: github_not_connected`,
 * `not_found: repository_not_installed`, `conflict: production_branch_missing`
 * (the branch the binding records is gone from GitHub),
 * `conflict: production_branch_is_init_branch` (the production branch is
 * `oxagen/init`, so pushing there would write to the production branch),
 * `conflict: oxagen_tree_exists` (the repository already has `.oxagen/`;
 * changing it is an ordinary pull request), `conflict: governance_toml_invalid`
 * and `conflict: workspace_toml_invalid`, and `conflict: github_refused` with
 * GitHub's own message when a push is refused.
 *
 * Roles: org Owner or Admin, or the workspace's Owner (INV-29), as
 * `link_repository`. A settings write: `noBillingGate: true`.
