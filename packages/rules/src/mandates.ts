/**
 * The mandate ledger writer and the decision-time check (MC spec §6.9 part
 * 3, ADR-059 decisions 4 and 5).
 *
 * `tools.mandate_ledger` is append-only movements on a mandate's remaining
 * authority, one row per measure. Every write here runs inside one
 * transaction that first takes `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the mandate row, so
 * concurrent calls serialise and two cannot both fit under one remaining
 * limit. Remaining authority is the limit's `perPeriod` less the period's
 * open reservations and settlements, computed under the lock from the
 * ledger's rows; `balance_after` records that figure after each row, and
 * every read reports the same formula. The unique index
 * `(mandate_id, tool_call_id, measure, kind)` is the database backstop.
 *
 * `checkMandate` is what the decision gate runs for an agent principal:
 * it looks the capability up as a declared tool, reads the version's
 * consequence tags and measures, finds the covering mandate, reserves, and
 * either lets the call proceed, parks it for a person, or refuses it.
