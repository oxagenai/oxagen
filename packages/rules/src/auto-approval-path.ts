/**
 * What happens when a decision rule sends a call to a person and an
 * auto-approval rule says it does not have to go (MC spec §6.9 part 2,
 * ADR-070).
 *
 * The gate asks this module at exactly one point: a `require_approval`
 * verdict, before it throws. The ask is READ-ONLY. It evaluates the clause
 * and, when a rule's conditions hold, hands back a `commit` that writes the
 * approval row already resolved, with `resolved_by_policy = policy:<rule id>`
 * and its single-use token spent. The gate calls it at the very end, once the
 * mandate check has cleared as well, because a mandate's own approval rule
 * runs after the rules and can still park the call — and a receipt saying no
 * person looked, for a call a person was required to look at, inverts the one
 * thing the `policy:` form exists for. When the conditions do not hold,
 * nothing is written and the gate throws exactly as it did before.
 *
 * The row is the receipt's evidence that no person looked. `resolved_by_user_id`
 * stays null, and the two columns cannot both be set (the migration's CHECK),
 * so an auditor can never read a policy decision as somebody's.
 *
 * A mandate's own approval rule is not answerable here. It parks the call
 * before the handler ever runs and outranks any workspace rule (§6.9 part 3),
 * so the evaluation on that path is recorded beside the parked row and the
 * row still waits for a person — `decideMandate` does that, and this module
 * never sees it.
