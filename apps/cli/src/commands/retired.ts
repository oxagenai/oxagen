 * The notice for a command that has been renamed and still works (ADR-103
 * phase 1). It differs from `printRetiredNotice` in both halves: it leaves the
 * exit code alone, because the command runs and a script that depends on it
 * keeps passing, and it names the replacement.
 *
 * Naming the replacement is the point. Hiding the old spelling from `--help`
 * takes away the operator's other way of finding the new one, so this line is
 * the migration guidance rather than a courtesy. "Moving to" rather than "moved
 * to" on purpose: the commands land on the new group in a later phase, and
 * promising a command that does not accept the same invocation yet would send
 * the reader somewhere that fails.
