// The §2 layer matrix and platform-package allowlist of ARCHITECTURE.md as data,
// consumed by import-graph.test.ts. Paths are posix and relative to `src/`
// without extension; a directory import ends in `/index` (parse.ts).
//
// Readings this file settles, each recorded in the PR that made it (WL-01
// unless named):
// - The named rows of the platform allowlist add to the base row ("everything
//   else under src/"): kernel.ts reports to telemetry (§3.2 steps 0 and 6), so
//   the base row's `captureError` must reach it.
// - `@oxagen/ui` is the shared component library, not a platform package: it
//   touches no store and no kernel, and the root layout and sidebar import it,
//   so it is outside the platform set.
// - `src/i18n/**` has no row in §2; it is treated as a leaf like `src/shared`
//   (it may import only itself). The one edge into it, `app/layout.tsx` →
//   `@/i18n/catalogs`, is a baseline entry for WL-33's root-layout rewrite.

    // `Read` across into INV-19's shape, so it is part of the same seam surface

    // `get_repository_tree`), one per bound repository, and some happen only
    // when a person opens a picker or a dialog. Making them all at render
    // would hold the whole page on the slowest of them. So the page asks for
    // each record when it needs it, through a "use server" module
    // that resolves its own viewer, exactly as a write does. A read from a
