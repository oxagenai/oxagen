// The Repositories page's view models (MC spec §10.1, §10.2, §11.4): the
// workspace's main repository, whether a GitHub App installation is attached,
// the set of repositories that installation reaches, what each bound
// repository holds under `.oxagen/`, and the pull requests Oxagen has open.
//
// The main repo is where `.oxagen/` lives — published steering records, the
// promotion ledger, and every agent definition under `.oxagen/agents/`. A
// workspace has exactly one, and until it is bound the workspace is
// provisional: runs record and spend counts, but steering and agent
// definitions stay off.
//
// These are types rather than zod schemas, and deliberately so. Every other
// view model in this directory exists because its port maps a contract record
// into a different shape and parses the result at the boundary (§3.4);
// `get_main_repository` and `list_installation_repositories` were written for
// this surface and answer in exactly this shape, so a schema here would parse
// a record the contract's own output schema has already parsed and could never
// refuse — dead code with a `record_unmappable` branch no test could reach.
// What the app still needs is its own name for the record, so that a contract
// that drifts fails where the action returns it rather than somewhere in the
// dialog: the actions declare these types as their return, and the compiler
// does the checking the parse would have done.
//
// Only the two records an action returns are exported. The three that compose
// them — MainRepository, GitHubInstallation, InstallationRepository — stay
// local: a consumer of `WorkspaceRepository` reaches its parts through it and
// needs no separate import, and `knip --production --strict` (CI's `checks`
// job) fails an exported type nothing imports. Export one only when a caller
// actually names it.
//
// A URL is a plain string here. Narrowing it to a linkable value is
// `parseGitHubUrl` in `@/shared/github-url`, which this layer may not import
// (§2: a view model imports only other view models), so the dialog narrows it
// at render, the way the Steering page narrows a pull request URL.
