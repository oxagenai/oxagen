// The Repositories page's GitHub setup (MC spec §10.1, §10.2, §11.4): the main
// repository panel and, below it, the bound repositories (bound-repositories.tsx)
// that it links and unlinks. Both used to live in a Workspace settings dialog
// opened from the workspace menu. The menu no longer carries Settings, and
// nothing the dialog did was dropped: installing or connecting the GitHub App,
// attaching an installation, binding the main repository, reconnecting a retired
// binding, re-approving its branch, and linking or unlinking a second
// repository all happen here, on the page the mockup draws for them.
//
// Why the main repository matters: it is where `.oxagen/` lives (published
// steering records, the promotion ledger, and every agent definition), and
// until a workspace binds one it stays provisional. This panel opens the App's
// install door and then lists what the installation actually reaches, so the
// set on screen is the set `bind_main_repository` accepts.
//
// Every state it can be in is drawn, and none is faked: reading, no
// installation, an unconfigured deployment, a picker over a live GitHub list,
// a bound repository, and each refusal the three capabilities can give.
