 * Static lint for both Postgres migration folders. Runs in CI's `checks` job
 * (no DB connection) so structural mistakes are caught before a migrate ever
 * runs.
 *
 * `main()` lints packages/database/drizzle — the pre-Atlas ordinal series. No
 * runner applies it any more (Atlas owns Postgres), so this is a freeze guard:
 * the numbering must stay coherent because the files are still the historical
 * record the baseline snapshot was cut from.
 *
 *  1. Every file is named `NNNN_snake_case_description.sql` (4-digit ordinal).
 *  2. No duplicate ordinals — every migration owns a unique number.
 *  3. No gaps in the ordinal sequence, apart from the squashed range below.
 *
 * `lintAtlas()` lints the LIVE dir, packages/database/atlas/migrations (see
 * its own docblock). `checkAtlasBaseline()` is the git-aware half of that
 * lint (see its own docblock for why the filesystem-only checks above it
 * cannot catch a migration stamped behind the branch it merges into, #3387).

/**
 * The git-aware half of the Atlas lint (#3387): every migration a branch adds
 * relative to its merge base with the default branch must sort AFTER the
 * highest version already in that merge base.
 *
 * WHY THE FILENAME/COLLISION CHECKS ABOVE CANNOT CATCH THIS
 *   `lintAtlas()`'s duplicate-prefix and atlas.sum checks are filesystem-only:
 *   they know what is on disk right now and nothing about history. A migration
 *   stamped behind the branch it will merge into collides with nothing and
 *   drifts from nothing, so it passes both checks silently. Atlas keys
 *   applied revisions by the version prefix, so a database that already
 *   applied the later revisions never applies this one at all (#3387, the real
 *   case: PR #3337 stamped a migration 20260918161000 while the branch's merge
 *   base already carried migrations up to 20260918200000).
 *
 * TWO COMPARISONS, TWO SEVERITIES
 *   - Against the MERGE BASE: fails. A migration stamped at or before the
 *     merge base's own maximum was wrong the moment it was written. Nothing
 *     that has happened to the default branch since is responsible for that.
 *   - Against the default branch's CURRENT tip: warns. The default branch
 *     moves under a long-lived PR, so a migration that cleared its merge base
 *     can still fall behind by the time it merges. That is not an authoring
 *     mistake, and blocking it would punish branch age rather than the defect
 *     this check exists for; the merge-base comparison already caught that.
 *
 * "ADDED" IS A FILE-SET DIFF, NOT A LINE DIFF
 *   `currentFiles` (the working tree) is compared against the merge base's
 *   file SET, not against a line-oriented diff of the two. A migration a
 *   rebase or a merge carries forward unchanged is in both sets and is never
 *   reported, no matter what the diff between the two commits looks like.
 *
 * DEGRADING HONESTLY
 *   `mergeBaseOf` and `atlasFilesAtRef` never throw; a git failure (shallow
 *   clone, tarball checkout, an unfetched `baseRef`) returns `status:
 *   "degraded"` with a `note` explaining why the ordering check did not run.
 *   The caller prints that note rather than staying silent: a shallow clone
 *   must never read as "ordering verified".
 *
 * Needs no database connection: `git merge-base` plus two `git ls-tree`
 * listings, so this stays in the DB-less `checks` CI job.
